# To run

Currently, `.env` file is ignored from version control.

```
touch .env
```

inside the `.env`:

```
MUX_TOKEN_ID=[your mux ID token]
MUX_TOKEN_SECRET=[your mux token secret key]
```

:NOTE: perhaps these keys should be put inside of the GitHub env variables.

_To run the app:_

.Install dependencies:
```
bundle install
```

```
rackup
```
