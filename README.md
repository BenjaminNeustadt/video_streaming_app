# Video streaming app

This application allows you to stream videos seamlessly. It integrates with Mux for media hosting and offers functionalities like uploading assets (for an admin account only), managing metadata(for an admin only), and tracking user activity(for an admin only).

This version is currently in the alpha stage, meaning it's a work in progress with core features already functional but not yet polished for production use.

Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute, or simply try out the app by cloning it locally and using your own API keys.

This is the _alpha_ version, and is currently not GDPR compliant.
Much of what exists is built in a spike, with ideation for future features and functionality in mind.

# To run

Currently, `.env` file is ignored from version control.
In order for it to run, write your own `.env` with necessary credentials.
Currently the logs/app.log and logs/app_error.log is not automatically
created. In order for the app to run do:


*Build the database locally:*
```
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:migrate
touch logs/app.log logs/app_error.log
```

A message will appear in the monitoring panel to inform whether there is a discrepancy
between what is currently stored in Mux, and what is in the database (your local database).

*Make the log files:*
```
mkdir logs
touch logs/app.log logs/app_error.log
```

*Then create the env file:*
```
touch .env
```

*inside the `.env`:*
```sh
# Include your own keys and credential values:

```

:NOTE: these keys can also be put inside of the GitHub env variables for a production environment scenario.

_To run the app:_

.Install dependencies:
```
bundle install
```

.Run the app:
```
rackup
```

3. User IP Data Extraction and Logging

The app extracts and logs user IP data to enhance monitoring, tracking, and potential user management. This feature helps gather geographical and network-related data from users accessing the platform, which can be used for a variety of purposes, including security, analytics, and personalization. As it stands, since this is not a paid for service and there is no user agreement, this version is not GDPR compliant. An alternative solution would be to integrate firewall rules onto a cloud server, but that would necessitate hosting the app somewhere with more granular configuration possible than Heroku (AWS, or Azure).

_How It Works_
IP Data Extraction: The app extracts the user's IP address and other related information, such as geographical location (city, country, region) and network details (ISP, VPN status, etc.), from an external IP geolocation API. 

* Logging and Storing Data: This data can be logged either:

- In a database...
... using Sinatraâ€™s ActiveRecord to store the information in a User model, which can later be viewed via an admin panel. This option would allow detailed user tracking and the ability to find users who have visited multiple times.

- Or in a log file or CSV file...
... stored in AWS S3 for a simpler approach, particularly for a less complex system.

- Further Considerations: 
AWS SNS could be used to trigger notifications (such as emails) whenever specific user activities occur. This could be useful for monitoring suspicious activities or tracking engagement.

_Why This Is Useful_
Security: Identifying users based on IP addresses can help in blocking or restricting certain users from accessing the site, especially in case of suspicious activity.

* Analytics: 
Tracking geographical and network information allows for gathering insights on user demographics and engagement levels.

* User Management:
Storing and logging IP data helps track returning users, providing a better understanding of user behavior and potentially enabling features such as personalization.

By implementing this feature in stages, starting with logging user data to the index page, the app can gradually move toward a more comprehensive data extraction and management system.

# Known bugs or errors

The app is not currently running due to AWS account neglect and issues. These should first be resolved and the relevant resources will need to be remade before the app is up and running and again.

- error on line 173:
It seems that now that `@ip_address = request.ip` the app controller will fail as the vpn api checks will use an ip address of ::1 which will not be able to return anything...

Something should be done to distinguish between both modes then...

- ajax not working on mobile as in desktop
the result of this is that we do not get the time spent on site for mobile users
